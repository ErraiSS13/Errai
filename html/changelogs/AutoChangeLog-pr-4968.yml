  - {balance: 'Adjusts how suffocation works, meaning characters who were drowning
      or in asystole start breathing as soon as the issue is resolved, rather than
      counting down a timer instead. This might make brief bouts of drowning/cardiac
      arrest more survivable. Please report any weirdness with breathing/suffocation
      on the issue tracker.'}
